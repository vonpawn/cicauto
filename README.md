# This project is very much a WIP and is likely only useful for educational purposes at the moment

Uploading in this current state so I can safely experiment with adding the following:

* GUI (RE-WX: https://github.com/chriskiehl/re-wx)
* Separating config from code
* Generalizing screen coords and images


Setup:
Download tesseract exe from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
Install this exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR

TODO: venv+requirements, calibration, config, tutorial video(s)
